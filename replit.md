# SEO Toolbox

## Overview

SEO Toolbox is a comprehensive web application that provides essential SEO tools for content creators and digital marketers. The application offers four main tools: Meta Description Generator (AI-powered), Title Case Converter, Keyword Density Analyzer, and Blog Outline Generator (AI-powered). Built as a modern full-stack application with React frontend and Express backend, it features a clean, responsive design using shadcn/ui components and provides both instant processing tools and AI-enhanced content generation capabilities.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side uses a modern React architecture with TypeScript, built around a component-based design system. The application leverages shadcn/ui for consistent UI components and implements client-side routing with wouter. State management is handled through React Query for server state and React Hook Form for form validation with Zod schemas. The design system is built on Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming, supporting both light and dark modes.

### Backend Architecture
The server follows a RESTful API design using Express.js with TypeScript. The architecture separates concerns through dedicated route handlers, with API endpoints for each tool (`/api/meta-description`, `/api/title-case`, `/api/keyword-density`, `/api/blog-outline`). Business logic is abstracted into service functions, and the application includes comprehensive error handling middleware with structured logging.

### Data Storage Solutions
The application uses a dual-storage approach: a PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for production data persistence, and an in-memory storage implementation for development/testing. Database migrations are managed through Drizzle Kit, with schema definitions centralized in the shared directory for type safety across frontend and backend.

### Authentication and Authorization
Currently implements a basic user system with in-memory storage for development. The architecture supports user creation and retrieval by ID or username, with the storage interface designed to easily swap between memory and database implementations.

### Form Validation and Type Safety
Implements comprehensive type safety using Zod schemas shared between frontend and backend. All API requests and responses are validated against these schemas, ensuring data consistency. React Hook Form integrates with Zod resolvers for client-side validation with real-time feedback.

### AI Content Generation
Integrates with Hugging Face's Inference API for AI-powered features. The system uses the `google/flan-t5-small` model for generating meta descriptions and blog outlines, with configurable parameters for temperature and token limits. Error handling includes fallbacks and user-friendly error messages.

### Build and Development System
Uses Vite for frontend development with hot module replacement and React support. The build process handles both client and server bundling, with esbuild for server-side compilation. Development includes specialized Replit integrations for enhanced debugging and error reporting.
